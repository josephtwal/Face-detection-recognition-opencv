# Face-detection-recognition-opencv

the code is implemented on virtual enviroment python 3.8.7 opencv 4.5.2 numpy 1.20.
Building a dataset from a video and train these images to detecte faces from a video.
extracting each frame from a video to get images.
for the purpose of this project i did not train all the frames, i only took 10 frame of each person and the reason for that is because i have a lot of frames and my pc start to crash when i train all of the frames.
there is a script at the end to detect faces from short video of both of them and sometime the detection fails due to not enough samples being trained but i trained and test all of the frames i will be able to get better result.
I hope you will enjoy my work :)
